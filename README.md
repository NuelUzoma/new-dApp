## Introduction

This dApp converts hexadecimal strings to uppercase and keeps track of users and successful conversions. It uses Cartesiâ€™s off-chain computation capabilities to process requests efficiently.

## Features

- Converts hexadecimal strings to their uppercase equivalents.
- Tracks users who submit strings for conversion.
- Counts the total number of successful conversions.
- Handles simple routing to provide user and transaction data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
- Docker installed for running Cartesi services.
- [Cartesi](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-machine/) installed and configured.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/string-uppercase-dapp.git
    cd string-uppercase-dapp
    ```

2. Build the dApp using Cartesi:
    ```bash
    cartesi build
    ```

## Usage

### Running the dApp

1. Start the Cartesi machine:
    ```bash
    cartesi run
    ```

### Sending Inputs

1. To convert a hexadecimal string to uppercase, send the input string to the Cartesi machine using:
    ```bash
    cartesi send
    ```

2. The machine will process the string and return its uppercase version. If the string is not in hexadecimal format, the request will be rejected.

### Inspecting Data

1. You can inspect the list of users who have submitted requests:
    ```bash
    cartesi send
    ```

2. You can also check the total number of successful conversions:
    ```bash
    cartesi send
    ```

## Cartesi Commands

- **cartesi doctor**: Check if your Cartesi environment is properly set up.
    ```bash
    cartesi doctor
    ```

- **cartesi build**: Build the Cartesi machine and prepare the dApp for execution.
    ```bash
    cartesi build
    ```

- **cartesi run**: Run the Cartesi machine, which executes the dApp.
    ```bash
    cartesi run
    ```

- **cartesi send**: Send data (like strings) to the Cartesi machine for processing.
    ```bash
    cartesi send
    ```
